# College_Website
This website basically consists of Login, Logout and  Contact Us pages.

For running this particular website you have to install Eclipse IDE.Then create a dynamic project with name College_App.After this you have to setup Tomcat server and also install mysql for database connectivity.Then create jsp files for each page for example login.jsp,logout.jsp and so on.
Then create package under src/main.java file inside this create servlet for each file.
Then we can write the code in jsp as well as servlets file for database connectivity.
so in this we can setup whole website in working state.

Here i am attaching the screenshots for output:
